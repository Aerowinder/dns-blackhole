**Get-List.ps1** downloads all of the below host files and strips out the information that isn't needed (like comments and whitespace) and combines them together for a singular entry into your preferred DNS blackhole application.

**Search-Blackhole.ps1** searches the completed domain block file (block.txt) for your query, showing everything that matches. Can be useful to help fish out additional domains that may require allow listing.


The dns-blackhole project aggregates the below host file lists:
